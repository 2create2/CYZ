# CYZ

Code Your Zero

“CYZ is a paired coding platform to enable secure messaging 
by utilising user generated code with images combined, 
to form your own one of a kind message, your way.”

The "Why?":

Other more common apps, are increacingly becoming 
less secure and less trusted. CYZ attempts to fill that void,
by putting the user in control.

The "What?":

CYZ is a paired tool. As it stands, CYZ is able to take a specific 
length of "text code" and convert it to an image. 

Future features I think CYZ would benefit from:

*Code generator utility/templates
*Menu
*Custom Virtual keyboard with key bindings
*Customisable background and better visual representation
*Logo and splash screen
*Console/messages/prompts
*testing
