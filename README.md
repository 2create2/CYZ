# CYZ

<h3>Code Your Zero</h3>

<i>“CYZ is a paired coding platform to enable secure messaging 
by utilising user generated code with images combined, 
to form your own one of a kind message, your way.”</i>

<b>The "Why?":</b>

Other more common apps, are increacingly becoming 
less secure and less trusted. CYZ attempts to fill that void,
by putting the user in control.

<b>The "What?":</b>

CYZ is a paired tool. As it stands, CYZ is able to take a specific 
length of "text code" and convert it to an image. 

<b>Future features I think CYZ would benefit from:</b>

<p><s>*Code generator utility</s>/templates &#9989;</p>
<p>*Menu</p>
<p>*Custom Virtual keyboard with key bindings</p>
<p>*Customisable background and better visual representation</p>
<p>*Logo and splash screen</p>
<p>*Console/messages/prompts</p>
<p>*testing</p>

<b>Attention!:</b>
<i>"temp.py" is temporary code for you in place, to get started.
It is by no means secure. It is for example purposes.
Please edit this if you want to send your own secure message.</i>
